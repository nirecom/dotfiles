Start a LangChain task (phase implementation, incident response, or improvement)

## Arguments

$TASK_ID - Task identifier (e.g., 3E, 4, incident-xxx)

## Procedure

1. Read PJ global docs:
   - `../ai-specs/projects/engineering/langchain/architecture.md`
   - `../ai-specs/projects/engineering/langchain/progress.md`
2. Read the target repo's `CLAUDE.md`
3. Read `.context-private/handoff-phase{$TASK_ID}.md` (if exists)
4. Read `.context-private/completion-phase{prev}.md` (if exists — determine prev from progress.md)
5. Read `../ai-specs/projects/engineering/langchain/ops.md` (for incident/infrastructure tasks)
6. Cross-check handoff against higher-priority documents:
   - **Priority 1**: PJ global docs (`architecture.md`, `progress.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
   - **Priority 2**: Previous completion report
   - **Priority 3**: Current handoff
7. If conflicts found, present them to the user before proceeding
8. Present a work plan to the user and wait for approval before starting implementation

## Rules

- If no handoff document exists, ask the user for task scope
- Never start implementation without presenting the plan first
- ai-specs is PRIVATE — never reference its content in commits to public repos
